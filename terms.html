        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 8, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to LucidAI. By downloading, installing, or using the LucidAI application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>LucidAI is a mobile application that uses artificial intelligence to generate dream visualizations, stickers, and dream interpretations. The App provides AI-powered creative tools for personal, non-commercial use.</p>

        <h2>2. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
        <p>LucidAI offers auto-renewable subscription plans:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monthly Plan:</strong> Provides 20 generations per month (images, stickers, and interpretations).</li>
            <li><strong>Yearly Plan:</strong> Provides 30 generations per month (images, stickers, and interpretations).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Subscribers may also purchase a consumable top-up pack of 30 additional generations, valid for 30 days from the date of purchase. Top-up packs are only available to active subscribers.</p>

        <h2>3. Billing and Renewal</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase.</li>
            <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
            <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
            <li>You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings in the App Store after purchase.</li>
            <li>Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Generation Allowance</h2>
        <p>Monthly generation allowances reset at the beginning of each billing period. Unused generations do not roll over to the next period. Each image generation, sticker creation, or dream interpretation counts as one generation.</p>

        <h2>5. AI-Generated Content</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All images, stickers, and interpretations are generated by third-party AI services and are provided "as is."</li>
            <li>AI-generated dream interpretations are for entertainment purposes only and do not constitute professional psychological, medical, or therapeutic advice.</li>
            <li>You may use AI-generated content for personal, non-commercial purposes.</li>
            <li>We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any AI-generated content.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Resell, redistribute, or commercially exploit AI-generated content from the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Welcome to Dreamoir. By downloading, installing, or using the Dreamoir application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and End User License Agreement ("Agreement"). If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. License Grant</h2>
        <p>The developer grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes on any Apple device that you own or control, subject to the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions.</p>
